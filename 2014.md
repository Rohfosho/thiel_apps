**What do you want to work on over the next 2 years?**

I want to spend the next two years of my life working on Cosmos Browser -- A browser for smartphones that lets you access the internet through SMS rather than WiFi or Mobile Data.

**Why spend your time on this?**

The advancement of society is heavily reliant on information. Many third world countries are still not developed enough because they lack the access to information. Though a simple browser through text messages may not be the savior, it certainly is a step in the right direction. By enabling internet through SMS (something a lot of the countries have), another route is given to the millions of terrabytes of data available on the web in hope to rekindle the fire of innovation. 

**Do you have any collaborators or cofounders? If yes, who are they?**
